            <h3>About</h3>
                <p>I was born in Farmington, New York. Farmington is a town located in the northern part of Ontario County, New York, United States. The population was 11,825 at the 2010 census. Farmington is about twenty-five miles southeast of Rochester, New York. The town was named after Farmington, Connecticut. Farmington was part of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase. The town was formed along with its county in 1789, and settlement of the region began the same year. Many of the early settlers were Quakers from Berkshire County, Massachusetts. In 1824, Arthur Power left Farmington with two of his sons and other Quakers to found Farmington, Michigan. The Farmington Quaker Crossroads Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. The land, at an average elevation of 600 feet above sea level, is compressed by the Wisconsin glaciation and slopes from an elevation of 700 feet at the southern border with the town of Canandaigua, to 500 feet at the north boundary with the town of Macedon. The land comprises drumlins and eskers. Other than streams and ponds, there are no major water landmarks. Public drinking water is provided by treated water piped from Canandaigua Lake. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 39.5 square miles (102 km2), all of it land. The New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) passes across the town. New York State Route 332 is a north-south highway, and New York State Route 96 is an east-west highway. The north town line is shared by the town of Macedon in Wayne, County.</p>

                <p>The earliest recorded population of Farmington was 4,214 from the 1820 census. Interestingly, the population dropped 58% to 1,773 by the 1830 census, and the population never went back above 2000 until the 1960 census, where the population jumped to 2,114, 51.1% above 1,399 the year before. The Ontario County Wiffle Association also calls Farmington home. The league has produced the 2012 National Champion Freaky Franchise and 2014 National Champion HTML. Fire protection is provided by the Farmington Volunteer Fire Assoc., which has two fire stations within the town: Station #1, located in "Pumpkin Hook" in the north section and Station #2, located at State Route 96 and Hook Rd near the business district. The Ontario County Sheriff's department provides law enforcement in the town as well as the New York State Police. The New York State Police Troop E headquarters is located in Farmington and serves a 10-county region. Victor-Farmington Volunteer Ambulance provides EMS service to the town. Farmington is also provided advanced emergency medical service by the Ontario County Advanced Life Support unit as well as Mercy Flight, a locally based medivac helicopter. Finger Lakes Gaming and Race Track, the only privately owned Thoroughbred horse-racing track in New York state, Ultrafab, the manufacturer of weatherstripping and related products, and Unisource, a supply company, call the town their home.</p>
