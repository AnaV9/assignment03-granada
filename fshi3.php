		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p> I am an American born Chinese. I grew up in Aroura, Ohio, later moved to Acton, Massachusetts, and then to Qingdao, China, and most recently Shanghai, China. I moved around a lot growing up and so I don’t really have any attachments to a certain location and to me home is wherever my family is rather than a city. Maybe because of all the moving around I have come to enjoy travel. I want to be able to go to as many places as I can and just explore the world. Life on the road would the dream. For periods of time in my life I literally live out of a suitcase!
		</p>

		<h2>Work Experience</h2>
		<p>In terms of paid work, over this past summer I taught English and Science for elementary school students at an intensive summer camp in Qingdao, China. I was given the opportunity to create the courses from scratch based on as set of parameters and teach the students in a fun and active way. I would teach them English (which wasn’t their first language) through various games, activities, experiments, and field trips. Through the experience I’ve learn how to work with younger kids, experienced the joy and difficulties of teaching, and grew as an individual, learning more about myself and my capabilities.
		</p>

		<p>I am currently also working on campus at the University of Rochester as teaching lab assistant for Bio and Chem labs. I work with various science equipment, set up and tear down labs, and help with things here and there around the teaching labs. Through this job I’ve made some good friends and learned about science unintentionally. Some of the things that I’ve had to do for the job would sound both interesting and crazy to some, such as identifying the sexes of thousands of Nasonia wasps in their pupa stage through microscopes.
		</p>

		<p>In addition to paid work, I have also work as a volunteer at central hospital a couple summers ago and taught chess.</p>

		<h2>Academic</h2>
		<p>I study financial economics and computer science at the University of Rochester. I have taken classes in economics, accounting, marketing, and finance, and also courses in java, python, and html and css. I am very interested in web design and thus is the reason I am currently taking CSC174. I enjoy being able to create a website in the exact way you imagined it and have people be able to use your site and see your creation. I would love to learn more in this class about the back end of web design as well as the front on so that I can go to create bigger and better websites. I think it’s very important nowadays to be able to have the skills to make websites, as almost any company needs an online presence.
		</p>

		<h2>Things I want to share</h2>
		<p> Some of the things that I enjoy doing in my free time are playing basketball, working out, running, sightseeing, hiking, watching movies, reading books, and just hanging out with friends. I really enjoy nature and the outdoors. My favorite TV shows are Rick and Morty, Game of Thrones, and The Office.
