Assigment 3
Information Architect: Ana Vaquera
    Created HTML template and comments. Chose the three students because they are all computer science majors. The three students are ordered by last name. The article section is concerning the student themselves, i.e. about them so who they are and where they are from. The aside section has to do with the intial role that they chose for project 1.
Design Artist: Meghan Patrick
    Used F and Z patterns for the design of the website. Applied fonts and colors, (used CRAP principles to decide which items had the same color sequence and to indicate what section belonged together.)
Coder: Amber Williams
    Inserted the JS plugin and jQuery. Ensured that HTML and CSS code passed valdiaiton. Ensured code was clean and that PHP includes where used to factor out common elements.
