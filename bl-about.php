            <!--About and their work experience, two seperate headings-->
            <h3>About</h3>
                <p>Charlie studies in University of Rochester, double majoring in psychology and computer science. During her time in Rochester, she passionately devotes to social and developmental psychology and human computer interaction. Her interest in developmental psychology led her to contribute in the university kid's lab, while her knowledge in computer science helps her come up with solutions to meliorate the behavior coding system in psychology researches. She also has research experience in Zhejiang University , where she assisted similar developmental psychology researches on children's temperament. Charlie is enthusiastic about child development and hopes to turn this passion into a career.</p>

                <p>I am currently double majoring in psychology and computer science, which gives me 2 different sets of problem-solving techniques. My academic background in computational coding inspired me a lot when I do behavior coding and helps me coming up with ways to optimize the coding system. Also, due to the nature of most of the computer science classes, I have a lot of experience working on teams for projects.</p>

            <h3>Work Experience</h3>
                <p>As for my research experiences, last summer I was a research assistant at Zhejiang University’s developmental psychology lab. I scheduled meetings with families while doing behavior coding, and constantly came up with questions and solutions which made the experiment more rigorous and precise. For example, there was a task in the experiment where experimenter came into the room and pretend to be injured. The goal of the task was to measure child’s level of empathy. However, the original design was the parents sit on a chair in the room with the child and they were told to do nothing. I immediately raised question about the possibility that children’s action might be affected by parents doing nothing. Afterwards, I proposed to add an indicator in the coding system which measures how many times the child look back and forth between the “injured” experimenter and the parent, which can show the level of behavior inhibition due to parent’s presence. The research team took my proposal and modified their coding system.</p>

                <p>As for my experiences with kids, I have been doing volunteer work since I was 13. I had experience of teaching in summer school when I was 16. Also, in high school I started up a project to help out the local orphanage by organizing volunteers visiting the orphanage once a week and plan activities to raise money for the kids. I also had experiences working with families when I was a research assistant. I enjoy working with kids and have the ability to answer parents’ concerns in a professional setting.</p>

            <h3>Initial Role</h3>
                <h4>Coder</h4>
                <p>I chose to be the coder for the first assignment because it was my least confident role. Actually, I had experience in CSC 210 last semester and were pretty familiar with both frontend and backend web programing. However, the coding part of web design are still my least favorite ones. According to my team work experiences in last fall, teamwork demands lots of effort from each team member to help out other teammates and collaborate so that the website is functional. Having the idea that no single role will be entirely independent, I decided to take the hard work first and help my teammates get on track. Also, I still need a bit time to familiarize with the idea of a 3-person team.</p>
                <p>As coder I was be responsible for everything the user interacts with, from page load to every click and scroll. Checks to make sure everything in the front-end (not just JavaScript but also HTML and CSS) must work and work well (optimized). Images must be correctly prepped (optimized). Decides the particulars of plug-in usage and installation, web font installation, and general optimization and usage of all front- end technologies. I was also in charge of all server interactions using PHP and MySQL including the addition of all code in the HTML documents to handle the server-side interactions (server- side includes too). Responsible for the set up and manipulation of database(s). Leads team collaboration (Github) and manages the file structure.</p>
